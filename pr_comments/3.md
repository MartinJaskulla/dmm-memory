This is a little bit indirectly casting an `any` to the `GETGoal` type. I think this is a fairly common pattern so I don't have a massive issue with it but are you aware of any drawbacks to this approach and any ways that those drawbacks might be addressed? (Sorry that's vague, I'll elaborate in person).

Martin:

Although I am not entirely sure what you mean, a common problem is that there is no guarantee that the backend will respond with the expected response. The backend might update its interface or have a bug, in which case your types are wrong, which is actually worse than having no types.

Possible solutions might be:
- Runtime checks e.g. with [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- Using [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) for REST or GraphQL
