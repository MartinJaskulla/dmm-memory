Maybe this might come off as a little nitpicky. But, when I think of middleware I think of the code living somewhere in the middle of the stack such that it can modify both the input as it comes in and output as it goes out.

For example:

```
Input  -> Retry Middleware -> Core Game Logic
Output <- Retry Middleware <- Core Game Logic
```

In this case input is probably `(Move, CardId)` and output is `Move`.

In the current implementation, it feels like the effects are callbacks that are run after the core game logic executes.

If you were to rewrite the code such that the middleware lived above the core game logic, do you think that would help or hurt with the abstractions you have?

Nitpicky is great! Now I learned that _real_ middleware always needs to allow modifying both inputs and outputs ðŸŽ‰

I am probably missing something, but I considered placing the middleware above the core game logic and found it to be less convenient.

How can an effect manipulate the next move if it does not know how that next move looks like? So if the middleware runs before the core game logic, it needs to run the core game logic itself. After the middleware is done, the core game logic will run for a second time. This felt redundant to me.
