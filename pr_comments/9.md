I noticed that some functions are pure, like `revealCard`. While others aren't, like `checkMatch`.

Was there any intention to be pure or is that consequential? Is there a rationale or principle that a developer coming on board would be able to follow to know which methods mutate data and which don't?

At first I thought `checkMatch` was supposed to be encapsulated, but then I noticed it's being used by the [retry middleware](https://github.com/iknow/martin-jaskulla-project/pull/1/files#diff-847e7c9d29a3add1240b923606e5ebce4eb18ec92d64853f157d078ed6597092R65).

It would be useful to introduce a naming convention to differentiate between mutation and pure functions. In general I try to use pure functions wherever possible, but in the case of calculating the next game move it was just too convenient to make a copy and mutate, I could not resist.

In a real project it could be useful to forbid mutation and use something like [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

However there are scenarios where mutation is noticeably faster and uses less memory. I guess this might be why JavaScriptâ€™s `.sort() `method is using mutation for example.
