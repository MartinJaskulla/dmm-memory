I noticed that you expose the HTMLButton attributes on this base case but then proceed to drop those values from the props in the wrapper card components.

Could you explain the decision to not pass those props along from those components?

What I wanted to show:

- I imagined the components in the /Cards directory as a mini component library e.g. in Storybook (I should have explained that somewhere).
- This component library would only export the variants, but not the base component
- I wanted to show that it is possible to keep a flexible interface on internal base components while restricting some props on the exported variants.
- I chose a bad example, because restricting native HTML attributes rarely makes sense
