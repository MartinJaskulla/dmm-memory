I'm curious to know what the rationale was for putting the "time ran out" logic into the Countdown component and not, for example, in the GameProvider.

My reasoning was that the game itself does not need to have a countdown, it would still function  without one. I like that the game does not need to know if a countdown or other extra features exist. The game can just be extended from the outside without knowing about the extensions (open-closed principle).

I am always trying to maximise the amount of code that never has to change, which helps preventing regression bugs. Ideally, when adding a new feature, it should not involve changing existing code, but only adding new code. Likewise when deleting a feature, it should be sufficient to delete a file or directory.

Putting the “time ran out” logic into the component also allows a single feature flag in the JSX to hide both the countdown in the ui and remove the loosing condition.

Colocating the code like this also helps with maintainability and discoverability. For example if you are a new developer on a project and need to make a change to a countdown behaviour, you would probably look in the `Countdown` component first. Wouldn’t it be nice if everything would be right there and not scattered across many files (especially when using debuggers)?

Colocation also helps with merge conflicts. Imagine if 20 developers all added new features simultaneously to `GameProvider`.
