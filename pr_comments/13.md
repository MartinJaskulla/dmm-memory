In theory I like the idea of having a base component. In an ideal world, I think we would have a lot of rich native semantic elements out of the box that we could easily style and that those native elements would be good enough to act as base components.

Unfortunately, we often times don't have that. Base components can help mitigate that problem. But, there are still some places where I think it can create more problems or ambiguity, especially in the world of hooks.

For example, if I'm adding behaviors and interactive state in my base component, how do my variant components know how to style depending on the state? Especially if those behaviors and states are defined in the base component?

A very real example of how you might want to do this for a button. Safari only recently started supporting [focus-visible](https://caniuse.com/?search=focus-visible). Up until now it might have been useful to try to emulate that interactive state. Or, to use `focus-visible` in some environments but fall back in others.

> You can add functionality to all buttons by modifying the base component

To bring it back to what is written here. Do you think there are limitations to using base components? Am I depriving my variants from styling the buttons in certain states? Or am I just overlooking very simple solutions? How does one generally go about adding behaviors to the base component, yet express those through variant components?

This is the million dollar question. I really wish I knew how to build the perfect component 🙂

Let’s say depending on the state of the base component, the variant component wants to:

- Overwrite styles of the base component
    - The variant could pass down an event handler to sync its own state and set styles accordingly
    - The variant could overwrite base styles by using css attribute selectors if the base component expresses its state via custom data attributes e.g. `<button data-state=”loading”>`
- Style an additional html element (in the markup of the variant)
    - The variant could pass down an event handler to sync its own state and set styles accordingly
    - The variant could use the CSS`:has` selector ([browser support not great yet](https://caniuse.com/css-has))
- Change its own behaviour
    - The variant could pass down an event handler

An alternative approach would be to use [composition instead of inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA) to build your components. Instead of having a base component you could mix in the base styles and behaviours to each of the variants. I think using composition is more flexible, but this is not always what you want.

When I think "component", I immediately think "library component used by many teams across an organisation to enforce visual consistency", but this is not every component. The most important part about building a component is figuring out who will use it, how the consumer wants to use it and how you want the consumer to use it. Then there are plenty of patterns one can use e.g. inversion of control, slots, templates, variants, composition etc.

The base variant pattern is useful, if an organisation strives for visual consistency and wants to minimise the variations of e.g. a button across all their websites. Websites would be forced to only use non-modifiable variants from the library. If a website requires a new variant, they can open a PR themselves and the designers of the library team can review it. Then there is a single place to check all components used across all websites. If more flexibility is needed, the library team can introduce slots or other patterns.

Which patterns do you prefer for building components?
