```
export function createGame(goalItems: GETGoal['goal_items']): Pick<Move, 'cards' | 'cardIds' | 'hinted'> {
```

It seems like you have an interface called `Move`, which is the full abstraction of the game state. And then here you are returning some essence of a game (let's maybe say the game board).

In terms of the types, I'm curious to know why you didn't choose to make a `GameBoard` interface, as opposed to using advanced types to derive new anonymous types from `Move`.

Are there any pros and cons to either approach?

A pro of creating a `GameBoard` interface is that it could be reused elsewhere. This would make it is easier to find all the code dealing with this “essence of a game”.

On the flip side I don’t want to export interfaces for everything (especially in unit tests), because this would clutter IDE import suggestions with one-off things.

I think I would have created a `GameBoard` interface if another part of my app would do something with this “essence”. The question is whether to use `Pick` to create `GameBoard` or to create an independent interface and extend `Move` with it.

To me it feels like `Move` is the central part of my application and everything else like `GameBoard` just needs to adapt itself, which is why I prefer `Pick`.
