> A bit of a follow up question, does the `newGame` logic need to be kicked off as an effect? Can you think of a different UI that might avoid the problem described by design?

It does not need to be kicked off as an effect. As a matter of fact it absolutely should not be. Why did I do it then? I wanted to show that I am aware of React 18 calling `useEffect` twice as well as several solutions, because upgrading to React 18 was a major inconvenience in my current project. However it helped us to understand that we are overusing `useEffect` and found better places to put our effects.

[The best place to put effects are event handlers](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/keeping-components-pure#where-you-can-cause-side-effects:~:text=In%20React%2C%20side%20effects%20usually%20belong%20inside%20event%20handlers.) like `onClick` etc.

While [useEffect should be used for synchronisation with external systems](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1501737272999301121?s=20&t=Sg3ekfLWxCmy8pTOGADYjg).

In the case of `newGame` it would be better to either add a `<button> `to start the game or to use React Suspense.

Btw David Khourshid has a great [talk about placing effects in event handlers vs in useEffect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPoC-k7Rxwo).
